# Random password

Password generator that converts two strings (a name and a key) into a **strong, random-looking password**.

## Example

Let's say you would like easy to remember but strong and different passwords for your email, twitter and facebook accounts. First of all, you need to come up with an *easy to remember "key"* that you will use for all these accounts, "may the 4th be with you" for example. Then you have come up with *easy to remember names for all services*, say "yoda's ml", "yoda's tw" and "yoda's fb". Now you can use this tool to create different and strong passwords for each of your accounts by combining the selected names with the selected key:

*"yoda's ml"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"v38ukjtauEHw2ap"* as your password for your email account. *"yoda's tw"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"wsZqn/J7wr7EOzgC"* as your password for your twitter account. Finally, *"yoda's fb"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"nr4fffTJj7OjH"* as your password for your facebook account.
