# Random password

Password generator application that converts a name key pair into a **strong, random-looking password**.

The application *will not send or store* the entered data in any way, everything is calculated on your own machine.

## Example

Let's say you would like easy to remember but strong and different passwords for your email, twitter and facebook accounts. First of all, you need to come up with an *easy to remember key* that you will use for all these accounts, "may the 4th be with you" for example. Then you have come up with *easy to remember names for all services*, say "yoda's ml", "yoda's tw" and "yoda's fb". Now you can use this tool to create different and strong passwords for each of your accounts by combining the selected names with the selected key:

*"yoda's ml"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"v38ukjtauEHw2ap"* as your password for your email account. *"yoda's tw"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"wsZqn/J7wr7EOzgC"* as your password for your twitter account. Finally, *"yoda's fb"* with *"may the 4th be with you"* will give you *"nr4fffTJj7OjH"* as your password for your facebook account.
